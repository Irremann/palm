Palm tree mod by Irremann

based on mod mb_trees by MarkuBu

Differences:
Only palm trees!
Completely new palm model.
Palm trees can be found along the shores of seas and rivers in desert and savannah biomes (except silver sand desert).
Simplification of landing. Just place a coconut somewhere on any sand or soil.
For eat, coconuts must now be chopped with a hammer from the gravelsieve mod.
